A Clojure attempt at the bank kata: https://katalyst.codurance.com/bank

This kata is typical for OO languages but required different thinking when approaching from a functional aspect, especially when I didn't know any clojure before I started.

I tried to strictly follow TDD practices, but found the REPL to be too attractive at times. Now I know a little more about Clojure I will try again from scratch, read up a little on idiomatic Clojure too and incorporate good ideas I will have learned about.

For now, enjoy attempt 0.0.1 in Clojure :-)
